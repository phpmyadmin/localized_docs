msgid "When phpMyAdmin shows a piece of user data, e.g. something inside a user's database, all html special chars have to be escaped. When this escaping is missing somewhere a malicious user might fill a database with specially crafted content to trick an other user of that database into executing something. This could for example be a piece of JavaScript code that would do any number of nasty things."

msgid "An attacker would trick a phpMyAdmin user into clicking on a link to provoke some action in phpMyAdmin. This link could either be sent via email or some random website. If successful this the attacker would be able to perform some action with the users privileges."

msgid "The token is regenerated for every login, so it's generally valid only for limited time, what makes it harder for attacker to obtain valid one."
