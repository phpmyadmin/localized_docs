The latter one should be used unless you have a good reason not to do so. When compiling PHP, we strongly recommend that you manually link the MySQL extension of your choice to a MySQL client library of at least the same minor version since the one that is bundled with some PHP distributions is rather old and might cause problems see :ref:`faq1_17a`. `MariaDB <http://mariadb.org/>`_ is also supported (versions 5.1 and 5.2 were tested)."

In general, it should have at least the same minor version as your server - as mentioned in :ref:`faq1_17`. This problem is generally caused by using MySQL version 4.1 or newer. MySQL changed the authentication hash and your PHP is trying to use the old method. The proper solution is to use the `mysqli extension <http://www.php.net/mysqli>`_ with the proper client library to match your MySQL installation.
