#: ../phpmyadmin/doc/transformations.rst:19
msgid "You can apply different transformations to the contents of each column. The transformation will take the content of each column and transform it with certain rules defined in the selected transformation."

msgid "Say you have a column 'filename' which contains a filename. Normally you would see in phpMyAdmin only this filename. Using transformations you can transform that filename into a HTML link, so you can click inside of the phpMyAdmin structure on the column's link and will see the file displayed in a new browser window. Using transformation options you can also specify strings to append/prepend to a string or the format you want the output stored in."

msgid "Go to your *tbl\\_structure.php* page (i.e. reached through clicking on the 'Structure' link for a table). There click on \"Change\" (or change icon) and there you will see three new fields at the end of the line. They are called ':term:`Media type`', 'Browser transformation' and 'Transformation options'."

#: ../phpmyadmin/doc/transformations.rst:54
msgid "The field 'Browser transformation' is a drop-down field. You can choose from a hopefully growing amount of pre-defined transformations. See below for information on how to build your own transformation. There are global transformations and mimetype-bound transformations. Global transformations can be used for any mimetype. They will take the mimetype, if necessary, into regard. Mimetype-bound transformations usually only operate on a certain mimetype. There are transformations which operate on the main mimetype (like 'image'), which will most likely take the subtype into regard, and those who only operate on a specific subtype (like 'image/jpeg'). You can use transformations on mimetypes for which the function was not defined for. There is no security check for you selected the right transformation, so take care of what the output will be like."
msgstr ""

#: ../phpmyadmin/doc/transformations.rst:67
msgid "The field 'Transformation options' is a free-type textfield. You have to enter transform-function specific options here. Usually the transforms can operate with default options, but it is generally a good idea to look up the overview to see which options are necessary. Much like the ENUM/SET-Fields, you have to split up several options using the format 'a','b','c',...(NOTE THE MISSING BLANKS). This is because internally the options will be parsed as an array, leaving the first value the first element in the array, and so forth. If you want to specify a MIME character set you can define it in the transformation\\_options. You have to put that outside of the pre- defined options of the specific mime-transform, as the last value of the set. Use the format \"'; charset=XXX'\". If you use a transform, for which you can specify 2 options and you want to append a character set, enter \"'first parameter','second parameter','charset=us-ascii'\". You can, however use the defaults for the parameters: \"'','','charset =us-ascii'\". The default options can be configured using :config:option:`$cfg['DefaultTransformations']`"
